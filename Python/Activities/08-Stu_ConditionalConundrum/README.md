# Conditional Conundrum  

During this activity, you will be looking through some pre-written conditionals and attempting to figure out what lines will be printed to the console.

## Instructions
* Look through the conditionals within the provided code and figure out which lines will be printed to the console.

* Do not run the application at first, see if you can follow the thought process for each chunk of code and then place a guess. Only after coming up with a guess for each section should you run the application.

## Bonus

* After figuring out the output for all of the code chunks, create your own series of conditionals to test your fellow students. Once you have completed your puzzle, send it out to everyone so they can test it.
